This is a basic ray tracer written in C++ for  [UCSD's Computer Graphics course](https://goo.gl/8R5a1h).
Example output images can be found in the source directory as PNG files (also embedded below).
The text files of the same names, also in the source directory, are input files which describe
the scene in a simple human-readable format.

This project was written in Visual Studio Community 2015, which may be convenient if you are
running Windows and have Visual Studio. Otherwise, there may be some platform-specific quirks
with regards to the includes.
